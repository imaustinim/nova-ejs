# NOVA 
### /ˈnōvə/ - borrowed from New Latin, "newly visible star"

## Introduction
Nova is a platform where artists can raise equity for future projects and also connect with other professionals. With the rise of alternative asset classes, Nova allows fans and investors to help change lives with the potential of future returns. Unlike platforms such as gofundme, kickstarter, and indigogo, Nova provides an opportunity for users to reap what they sow.

## FAQ

***How accurate are the times to complete work?***
<br>
Not accurate at all. Honestly I have no idea what I'm doing...

<br>
Nope, similar to YouTube, you can upload videos while watching and leaving comments on others.

# Reflection
## What I'm proud of
1. I'm glad I was able to put a lot of effort in and reaffirm my drive for software engineering.
2. I was able to try a lot of different things out and learn a lot. Specifically heroku and bootstrap.
3. I think a project like this is quite viable.

## Lessons Learned and what to work on.
0. Create a damn wirefrime.
1. I need to know more about databases and authentication.
2. Focus on one thing at a time rather than just bouncing around.
3. Front-end looks quite amateur.

Overall, I'm pretty proud of my effort, not so much my execution but I don't think that matters at this point. 
I know that if I continue put in effort into this project, it can be a legitimate platform, which I plan to do.
